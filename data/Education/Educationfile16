I was amazed at the women’s enthusiasm for learning.I stayed in contact with several of the women after their release. Among them, one pursued a doctorate in education and another achieved a high-level corporate position.If more universities expanded their programs to include prisoners who grew up in underserved communities, there is potential to educate us all not only about the inequities in our society, but also about the aspirations of many inmates from underserved communities to acquire an education and become contributing members of society.The writer is a professor of literacy education at Montclair State University.To the Editor:Few realize that some years ago college courses were routinely offered in prisons. I am a retired professor of sociology. Decades ago, I was invited by a graduate student teaching at a Kansas prison to give a lecture.What I found were inmates hungry for knowledge. My thinking is this: University education should not only be free to all, but it should also be made freely available to those in our prisons.It may well be that education cannot cure all our social problems, but wouldn’t it be wonderful if it solved most of them? A country as great as ours should try.DAVE WILLER, LAWRENCE, KAN.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
