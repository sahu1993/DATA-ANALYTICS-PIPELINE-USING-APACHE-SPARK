Such process-driven skills are in high demand by employers in all industries, and we only harm our children — and their future career prospects — by withholding or limiting such instruction.Approving new education standards while simultaneously denying access to relevant supporting content simply pays lip service to the importance of STEM education without giving science teachers the tools they need to transform students into scientifically literate adults.If we want to prepare the next generation of students for a STEM-centered workplace, we need to begin with the scientific method. The development of critical thinking skills will not be possible without exposure to conclusions — even those regarding climate change — derived from scientific inquiry.While we may not always like the conclusions of such inquiry, we must follow the evidence, and teach our children to do the same.The writer is director of education for the Global STEM Alliance at the New York Academy of Sciences.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
