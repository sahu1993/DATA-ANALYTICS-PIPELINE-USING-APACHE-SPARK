AdvertisementSupported byWhen Idaho lawmakers scrubbed all mentions of human-caused climate change from the state’s education standards last year, they faced a swift backlash from teachers, parents and students who said that censoring science would leave students disadvantaged, jobs unfilled and the state unprepared for the future.The House committee’s decision is not final. The state’s Senate Education Committee will have a chance to weigh in, and the standards will need final approval from both chambers.“It’s about our children’s future and leaving our planet a better place,” Ms. Stutzman said.She and other teachers said they worried that without the supporting content — which is supposed to guide teachers in assigning coursework — teachers may simply choose not to teach climate change, putting their students at a disadvantage.“A lot of our teachers are not experts in science, they’re generalists,” said Jacob Smulkowski, a science teacher in Post Falls. “Teachers look to those standards for guidance.” Under the House-approved standards, teachers will need to collaborate and “figure out how to teach these things” as best they can, Mr. Smulkowski said.“When you have conclusions in standards, it stifles inquiry, and I don’t think that’s the intent of the department,” Mr. Syme said at the committee meeting Wednesday. He declined a request for an interview.Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, described the lawmakers’ decision to remove parts of the guidelines “wholesale” as “a continuation of the assault” on the inclusion of climate change in science standards in Idaho.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
