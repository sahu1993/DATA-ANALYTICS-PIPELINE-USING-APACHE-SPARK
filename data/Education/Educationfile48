At some Christian colleges, gay dating or marriage is forbidden, and same-sex couples are not permitted to live together in married-student housing.So far, attempts to withdraw accreditation over the same-sex marriage issue have been extremely rare. In 2015, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges raised questions about a student code forbidding “homosexual practice” at Gordon College, a Christian school near Boston. But the association let Gordon College keep its accreditation after it agreed to expand its support to gay, lesbian and transgender students.Barbara E. Brittingham, president of the commission that oversees higher education for the association, said the agency tried to ensure that one group of students was not treated differently from another. “There are many things in motion about American higher education,” she said, “and with that comes the obligation to make sure they are treating all students in a way that supports the students personally and academically.”But Everett Piper, the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, said it was unfair to equate religious belief with discrimination. His college’s handbook forbids behavior that promotes a “sexual identity outside of the scriptural expectation,” such as “homosexual P.D.A.,” or public displays of affection, part of a catalog of sexual behavior that may result in suspension or dismissal.“There’s a huge difference between discriminating against behavior and discriminating against a person,” Mr. Piper said.Another element of the bill addresses a common college practice — requiring religious student groups that want school funds or meeting space to admit any student, regardless of their faith, and to grant them all the same access to leadership positions. The measure, which would apply only to public universities, would prohibit them from having such policies if they wanted access to federal aid.The bill criticizes the use of campus “free speech zones” where such speakers are sometimes asked to stay within, but it would not bar the zones or stop colleges from setting rules. It would force colleges to publicly declare their speech policies, so if they tried to change the rules ad hoc, depending on who was speaking, they would be vulnerable to free-speech lawsuits.Though Republicans had been energized by attempts by students or colleges to mute conservative ideas, speakers of all political stripes would stand to benefit from the law, said Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a free-speech advocacy group.“People are censored by who they disagree with,” Mr. Cohn said. “Students are censored from all parts of the political spectrum for a variety of motives.”In a broad freedom of association provision, the bill would prevent colleges and universities from disciplining students based on their membership in a single-sex student organization, including fraternities and sororities. Republican congressional aides said this provision was inspired by Harvard’s new policy of denying certain privileges — like leadership positions and recommendations for fellowships — to members of single-sex social clubs. Harvard officials have said the organizations are anti-egalitarian and foster an atmosphere of sexual harassment, while club members say they should be allowed to associate with whomever they wish.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and Harvard alumna, was among those who worked on this provision, her spokesman, Tom Flanagin, said. Although Ms. Stefanik was not a member of a single-gender group at Harvard, he said, “she believes all schools should respect students’ right to freely associate.”Susan C.
