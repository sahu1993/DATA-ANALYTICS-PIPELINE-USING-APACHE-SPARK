The need remains urgent: Job creation and job preparation must go hand in hand.We suggest an approach that would allow tax credits for charitable donations to programs operated by nonprofit organizations for community-based apprenticeship initiatives, career and technical education, work-force development, and educational preparedness.The beneficiaries would be learners of all ages whose incomes don’t allow using 529 plans.JEANNE ALLEN, WASHINGTONThe writer is founder and chief executive, Center for Education Reform.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
