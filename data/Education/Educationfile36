Understanding this, President Barack Obama made higher education a clear priority, laying down a challenge to have the highest proportion of college-educated adults of any country.We are falling short of this goal, and now is not the time to abandon this countryâ€™s historical commitment to higher education.Instead of ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, we should make it easier for immigrant children to become part of the American dream.Instead of putting up financial roadblocks, our government should work on creative ways to make college more affordable to middle-class families.Instead of penalizing Americans who understand the value of supporting higher education, Congress should champion a tax structure to encourage philanthropy.We cannot sit idly by as our government leaders place less value on the lifelong benefits of the university experience. Now is the time to make educated arguments for the common good.The writer, a Jesuit priest, is president of the University of San Francisco.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
