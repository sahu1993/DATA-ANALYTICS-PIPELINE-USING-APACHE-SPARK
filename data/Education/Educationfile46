After all, they had side jobs in college; they ate Ramen noodles. That’s just how it goes.In New York, where a forthcoming study by researchers at the City University of New York reports that 30 percent of community college students and 22 percent of four-year college students are food insecure, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recently proposed that every public college open a free campus food pantry. This is a modest but welcome step, since even mere acknowledgment of the problem among top policymakers is rare.But while quick fixes are useful for the students who need food now, they are not long-term, preventive solutions. Charitable donations of cans of food and cartons of milk must be supplemented with changes to how food is distributed and priced on campus, and access to the SNAP food stamp program should be broadened for students.After all, it’s impossible to learn when you’re starving.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
